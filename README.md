# Algorithm Challenge #14 – Scalar Matrix Check (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This C++ program checks whether a given 3×3 matrix is a **Scalar Matrix**.

A Scalar Matrix is defined as:
- All diagonal elements have the same value
- All non-diagonal elements are equal to zero

An Identity Matrix is a special case of a Scalar Matrix
where the diagonal value equals **1**.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Understanding scalar vs identity matrices
- Diagonal-based matrix validation
- Using reference values for comparison
- Translating mathematical definitions into algorithms
- Writing clean and reusable matrix logic

🧩 Example
-
Matrix:

5  0  0  
0  5  0  
0  0  5  

Output:

YES: Matrix is Scalar.

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** scalar_matrix.cpp
- **Challenge Level:** Level 3
- **Challenge Number:** #14

💬 Notes
-
This challenge builds directly on the Identity Matrix concept.
It introduces abstraction by allowing any constant value on the diagonal instead of a fixed value (1).
